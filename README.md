Title: Artistic Generator
## Description
On the deployed website, there is an artistic generator which generates an approximate pixel version of the selected inspirational photo. Users can use the drag-down menu to see the generation of the other two photos. There is also a slider that allows users to see the generation in a slower mutation speed. The website will update the best design in the second image, as a better design is found in the process.
